# malanalyzer
MALExtractor is a custom-built class used to scrape the website MyAnimeList.net
The class' primary method, getTopAnimesUpToPage(), takes in a number of pages the user wants to scrape from the MAL's leaderboard, and returns a list of dictionaries.
Each dictionary contains standardized information on each anime.
